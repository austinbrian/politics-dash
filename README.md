# Mini dashboard for political data
----
This dash app takes a dataset that includes the countywide vote for president
as well as the aggregated totals from IRS data on each county for 2014. 

I want to use it to practice: 
1. A dash dashboard with multiple inputs and multiple graphs
2. A calculator for determining which variables in a logistic regression offer
   the best-scoring correlations with a target variable
3. A deployed web application
